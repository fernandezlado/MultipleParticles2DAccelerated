  - TEST THOROUGHLY THAT FIELD OBTAINED IS THE FIELD PRODUCED BY OTHER PARTICLES
    - EVALUATE EXACT FIELD AT ALL EQUIVALENT SOURCES AND COMPARE WITH EQUIVALENT FIELD

  - ADD CORRECTION TO NEIGHBOUR EQUIVALENT SOURCES

  - PROJECT FIELD INSIDE

  - COMPARE WITH EXACT EVALUATION

  - ADD NEIGHBOURS INTERACTIONS

  - ADD SELF INTERACTION

  - COMPARE WITH EXACT RESULT

  - DEBUG

  - In each cell, store amplitudes of cell's equiv. sources

  - Form large matrix summing equivalent sources of each cell (adjacent sides that share sources)

  - Convolve using FFT

  - Iterate through cell. Form little matrix adding neighbor sources.

  - Convolve using local FFT

  - Substract this result from global_field
